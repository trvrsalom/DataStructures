 * R8.4 Look at the public interface of the java.lang.System class and discuss
 * whether or not it is cohesive.
 *
 * It is not cohesive because it is too general purpose.
 *
 * R8.5 Suppose an Invoice object contains descriptions of the products ordered,
 * and the billing and shipping addresses of the customer. Draw a UML diagram
 * showing the dependencies between the classes Invoice, Address, Customer, and
 * Product.
 *
 *
 *         +---------+
 *         | Invoice |
 *         +----+----+
 *              |
 *              |
 * +---------+  |  +----------+     +-------+
 * | Product +--+--+ Customer +---->+Address|
 * +---------+     +----------+     +-------+
 *
 * R8.6 Suppose a vending machine contains products, and users insert coins in
 * to the vending machine to purchase products. Draw a UML diagram showing the
 * dependencies between the classes VendingMachine, Coin, and Product.
 *

 * R9.11 Which of these conditions returns true? Check the Java documentation for the
 * inheritance patterns. Recall that System.out is an object of the PrintStream class.
 * a. System.out instanceof PrintStream
 * True
 * b. System.out instanceof OutputStream
 * True
 * c. System.out instanceof LogStream
 * False
 * d. System.out instanceof Object
 * True
 * e. System.out instanceof String
 * False
 * f. System.out instanceof Writer
 * False
 *
 * R10.3 Suppose the class Sandwich implements the Edible interface, and you are
 * given the variable declarations:
 * Sandwich sub = new Sandwich();
 * Rectangle cerealBox = new Rectangle(5, 10, 20, 30);
 * Edible e = null
 * Which of the following assignment statements are legal?
 * a. e = sub;
 * Legal
 * b. sub = e;
 * Illegal
 * c. sub = (Sandwich) e;
 * Illegal
 * d. sub = (Sandwich) cerealBox;
 * Illegal
 * e. e = cerealBox;
 * Illegal
 * f. e = (Edible) cerealBox;
 * Illegal
 * g. e = (Rectangle) cerealBox;
 * Illegal
 * h. e = (Rectangle) null;
 * Illegal
 *
 * R10.6 Classes such as Rectangle2D.Double, Ellipse2D.Double, and Line2D.Double
 * implement the Shape interface. The Shape interface has a method 'Rectangle
 * getBounds()' that returns a rectangle completely enclosing the shape.
 * Consider the method call:
 * Shape s = . . .;
 * Rectangle r = s.getBounds();
 * Explain why this is an example of polymorphism.
 *
 * This is an example of polymorphism because s can be any shape, but it will still
 * work.
 *
 * R10.7 Suppose you need to process an array of employees to find the average
 * salary. Discuss what you need to do to use the Data.average method in Section
 * 10.1 (which processes Measurable objects). What do you need to do to use the
 * second implementation (in Section 10.4)? Which is easier?
 *
 *  One would need to implement the measurable interface type (10.1), or one needs
 *  to create another class which (measurableTester), which implements measurerer and
 *  returns it's own information for the data.average method to find the average.
 *
 * R10.11 Consider this top-level and inner class. Which variables can the f method access?
 * ```
 * public class T {
 * 	private int t;
 * 	public void m(final int x, int y) {
 * 		int a;
 * 		final int b;
 * 		class C implements I {
 * 			public void f() {...}
 * 		}
 * 		final int c;
 * 		...
 * 	}
 * }```
 *
 *	It can access final it can access a, b, c, and y, but not t.
 *
 * R10.12 What happens when an inner class tries to access a non-final local
 * variable? Try it out and explain your findings.
 *
 * You can access the variable, but you can't change it.
